Previously had a cylinder code  with Zhou-He BC.
Want to implement Regularised BC

Naming as per paper by Latt
BC2=Zhou and He
BC31=Reg BC(Rattan)
BC32=Reg BC(Parvez)

Last Friday: rho settled at 1.3 instead of 1

Shifted to channel flow instead of flow around a cylinder to save running time
ISSUE RESOLVED
1)In Rattan sir's snippet, calc of ux was missing at right side(Daal mein kuch kaala tha)
2)My and Rattan sir's formulation give almost same results for tau >=0.56
3)Rattan sir's work till 0.55. Mine works till 0.515

Shifting back to Cylinder. Not yet

New problem
Yesterday, in BC32 the Q_xx block was commented. On uncommenting the code blows.
BC31 still works fine

I am trying to match parabolic profile
BC2 Satisfactory(0.29% error)
BC31 Satisfactory(0.50% error in centerline velocity till 30000, 0.05% till 100000)

BC32 Code blowing. For tau=0.95 u=0.01, it blows later after showing reasonable results till 15000.
If I comment the Q_xx block, I get all plots as expected. Very interesting. An obvious omission
is giving a correct answer.

ISSUE RESOLVED
I was missing the summation on Stress tensor. Using eq38 and eq39 not necessary for BC3
BC3 working.(0.48% centerline vel error)

Renaming BC31 as BC4 and BC32 as BC3
SUCCESS
BC1(Inamuro): Error 0.29%

SUCCESS
BC5(Nonlinear): Error 0.5%
